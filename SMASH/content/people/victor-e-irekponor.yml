bio: >
  Victor Irekponor is a first-year Ph.D. student in the Center for Geographical
  Information Science, University of Maryland, College Park. He is broadly
  interested at the cutting-edge of research and development in urban
  informatics, smart cities, and geospatial data science; specifically, the
  science that investigates the ‘where’ and ‘why’ of various human and natural
  phenomena in cities. Before coming to Maryland, he studied at the University
  of Lagos, Nigeria and graduated with a first-class bachelor’s degree in urban
  planning. Beyond academics, Victor has over three years of software
  engineering experience as well as experience building and deploying machine
  learning models. His major tools include Python, Scikit-learn, Keras,
  Tensorflow, and React.js. He hopes to deploy his skills in software
  engineering, data science, and urban planning to conceptualize and contribute
  significantly to smart cities research.
